# Running the tutorials

## Running on cloud platforms

**Google Colab:** If you have a Google account, you can use [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/). This is an online service offered by Google that already contains many python packages. In the header of each notebook, you will find a link to the Google Colab version. Note that some notebooks require the installation of extra packages, in that case you will need to uncomment few lines on the notebook header. To run the notebooks on Colab, simply click on the Colab link in the header of each notebook.

## Running in local
