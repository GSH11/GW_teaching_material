# Data analysis Hands on

Welcome to the repository of the Data Analysis session hands-on for the [MaNiTou school 2022](https://indico.in2p3.fr/event/25990/timetable/#20220707). This repository hosts the Notebooks on which we will work together. All the notebooks contain an introduction part and some challenges that you can face with the commands learnt in the introduction part. 


# Running the tutorials

## Running on cloud platforms

**Google Colab:** If you have a Google account, you can use [Google Colab](https://research.google.com/colaboratory/). This is an online service offered by Google that already contains many python packages. In the header of each notebook, you will find a link to the Google Colab version. Note that some notebooks require the installation of extra packages, in that case you will need to uncomment few lines on the notebook header. To run the notebooks on Colab, simply click on the Colab link in the header of each notebook.

## Running in local

If you want to run the tutorials on your local computer you will need to install the required python packages. We suggest to follow the steps below

* Download and install with conda the igwn-py38 environment from [this page](https://computing.docs.ligo.org/conda/environments/igwn-py38/).

* Activate the conda environment with 

```
conda activate igwn-py38
```

* Clone this repository with 

```
git clone https://github.com/simone-mastrogiovanni/MaNiTou2022.git
```

* You are ready to go!
